known_limitations:
  - issue: Events and Create Event navbar links all point to / instead of their respective routes
    location: app/components/Navbar.tsx
    impact: Navigation links do not lead to separate pages
  - issue: Event detail pages at /events/{slug} do not exist yet
    location: app/components/EventCard.tsx
    impact: Clicking an event card will result in a 404 page
